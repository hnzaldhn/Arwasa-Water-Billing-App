# ARWASA: Water Billing using [Ionic - Angular Framework]

Water billing management system allows the water billing management to post the bill of each and every customer and any other transactions related to water billing such as customer information and all details. This proposed mobile application system can be accessed by the administrators and as well as the customers of the water billing. The administrator can access all the modules of the project whereas the customers can only view their payment history and billing records. This project talks about the major findings of the challenges of the manually operated billing and suggests a possible solution that will help solve the challenges that are currently faced. The solution to the above difficulties is to automate its water billing system.  The proposed mobile application system aims to provide and develop a mechanism that assures the reliability of customersâ€™ record, provide an accurate and prompt computation billing, and speed up the generation report or documents which are imperative in providing precise decision making, planning, and reporting.
